              <br>
              <p>The Healthy Chicago Equity Zones initiative deploys hyper-local strategies to confront the social and environmental factors that contribute to health and racial inequity – with the ultimate goal of closing Chicago’s racial life expectancy gap. Efforts began with community leadership of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, including outreach and engagement during 2021. These efforts focused on increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates and evolved to confront factors that contribute to health and racial disparities, including healthcare and social service access, food access, housing conditions, community safety, and the physical and the built neighborhood environment.</p>

              <br>
              <p>On July 17th, 2022, SWOP came together with over 100 member institutions to demonstrate what organizing together to reclaim their communities looks like. With a turnout of over 1,500 people, United Power for Action and Justice, Metro IAF, Lake County United, Dupage United and Fox Valley Initiative tackled what it means to reclaim their communities from gun violence, incarceration of those who require mental health assistance and the reclaiming of homes in their communities. With powerful speakers coming up to share their testimonies about the increase in gun violence and the lack of action taken to prevent these gun related crimes, they called for a change to gun laws and gun technology. When looking over the rate of incarceration against those with unchecked mental illness, those in attendance called out for resources to be placed into their communities to accommodate those who are struggling. When addressing the number of foreclosures, vacant homes, and vacant lots, they showed that they are still fighting for equity using reclaiming campaigns that fix those vacant lots and buildings and allow community members to purchase and move into them.</p>

              <br>
              <p>The Parent Mentor Program engages parents in their children's education. Parents participate in the program with very few prerequisites. In the interview process they are informed that they must have a child that attends the school they are applying to and that they are not allowed to volunteer in their own child’s class. Everyone is encouraged to have a proactive attitude to their children's education. Even grandparents who are considered to be the legal guardians/caretaker of their kids are encouraged to become Parent Mentors.</p>

              <p>For the first time in the history of the United States, Illinois now offers medical coverage to people regardless of their immigration status. The campaign started back in 2014 with a coalition of 70+ organizations; SWOP being one of them. In 2020, the coalition fought for and won coverage for people 65 and up, and in 2021 they were able to win coverage for people 55 and up. As of July 1, 2022, coverage is now extended to people 42 years old and up. To be eligible, you must live in Illinois, be 42 years of age and be at or below the 100% federal level of poverty.</p>

              <p>SWOP has been a part of a six-year long fight to put the power of police accountability into the hands of community members and give them input in how their communities are being policed. After many long hours, trials, and obstacles, SWOP can proudly say that the ordinance they played a big role in pushing has passed and was awarded the Woods Fund of Chicago Power of Organizing Award by the Chicago Neighborhood Development Awards (CNDA). SWOP could not be happier to share the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance and this video commemorating the achievement.</p>

              <p>Chicago Connected is a groundbreaking program that provides no-cost, high-speed internet service to Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students and their families. This first-of-its-kind program is one of the largest efforts by any city to provide internet access for students. SWOP has a team of callers who inform CPS families of their eligibility, connect families to their internet provider, and answer any questions that families may have regarding Chicago Connected.</p>

              <br>
              <p>In the wake of a worldwide pandemic, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) partnered with SWOP. SWOP enlisted the help of the leaders in the community and using CDPH funding, hired Contact Tracers and Public Health Ambassadors (PHA). SWOP’s goal is to provide much needed assistance as well as relief in these trying times. What started off as an effort to inform individuals and their families about the possibility of having been exposed to Covid grew to be a network of people discussing safety precautions, letting the community know about places they could get tested or get vaccinated and understanding the worries of those who were hesitant to receive the vaccine. To that end, PHAs set out to the streets, reaching out to their community members, and offering resources to assist them while also clearing up misinformation surrounding the virus and the vaccine.</p>
