      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The Southwest Organizing Project’s (SWOP) mission is to build a
        broad-based organization of Christian, Muslim and Jewish faith
        institutions, local schools and other institutions in Southwest Chicago,
        which will enable families to exercise common values, determine their
        own future and connect with each other to improve life in their
        neighborhoods. To this end, leaders of SWOP have dedicated themselves to
        building relationships across racial, ethnic, generational and faith
        differences and to bringing the common concerns of their institutions
        into the public life of the community as they develop the capacity to
        act collectively and “stand for the whole.”
      </p>
      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        As a broad-based organization committed to leadership development and
        collective action for the common good, SWOP members act to build deeper
        public relationships within and among the churches, mosques, schools,
        and other institutions in the neighborhoods they serve. Through this
        process, SWOP staff and primary leaders continually strive to identify
        and strengthen new leadership for public life.
      </p>
      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p>
        SWOP works with the constituents of its member institutions and with
        other stakeholders of Southwest Chicago. The 45 institutions that make
        up the membership of SWOP include Catholic parishes and a Lutheran
        church, an historic African American synagogue and a Muslim service
        organization, local elementary and high schools, CDCs, a community
        hospital and a school-based health center, and social service agencies.
        SWOP's member institutions are located in the Southwest Chicago
        community areas of Chicago Lawn, Gage Park, West Lawn, West Elsdon, and
        Ashburn and serve a population that is 73% Latinx (SWOP estimates that a
        large percentage of this population are immigrants), 18% African
        American, and 9% white, Arab-American, or other (all data as of 2018,
        from DePaul’s Institute for Housing Studies). The communities are low-
        and moderate-income with 18.6% of families living below the poverty line
        and 73.8% of households have an income below $50,000 (the Chicago Area
        Median Income for a family of four is $93,200). 
        <br /><br />SWOP’s member institutions represent 40,000 people living in the community. SWOP’s
        work benefits all members of these institutions. SWOP's leaders are
        drawn from everyone who lives and/or works in the community: congregants
        and leaders at local religious institutions; parents and educators at
        local schools; students engaged in after-school programs and youth
        leadership development activities; families seeking affordable housing
        opportunities; undocumented people living and working in the community;
        and, young people involved in street organizations. It is these leaders
        who act as SWOP’s board members and issue team decision-makers and
        ensure that SWOP’s work has impact across the entire community.
