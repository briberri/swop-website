      <h2>Our Organization's Work</h2>
      <p>
        SWOP’s work aims to advance racial equity and economic justice. The
        Reclaiming Southwest Chicago Campaign is one example of this. Starting
        in the early 2000s unscrupulous real estate agents and mortgage brokers
        targeted Southwest Chicago as a community where they could sell products
        to buyers of color. These agents and brokers sold mortgages and services
        that the buyers could not afford, did not need, or that took advantage
        of their inexperience. The ultimate result was that they stripped the
        community of wealth and left a wake of destruction in vacant homes and
        distressed lives that is still reverberating through the community
        today. <br /><br />SWOP’s campaign seeks to redress this wrong by
        organizing to make it right. SWOP built leadership and power through its
        member institutions so that local stakeholders could plan and execute a
        strategy to address the vacant buildings and the increases in crime and
        decreases in school performance that went along with them. Local leaders
        identified development and funding partners, secured resources, and
        undertook the programs needed to reclaim the community. Through this
        effort, the community is safer, homes are affordable, and schools are
        succeeding. All of which gives residents the start to an equal
        opportunity to succeed in our city. <br /><br />SWOP carries out similar
        campaigns when it fights for improved education through the Parent
        Mentor Program, ensuring a place for all Citizens through Know Your
        Rights trainings and Citizenship efforts, and community safety and
        police accountability through Communities Partnering 4 Peace and the
        Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability. SWOP is the Chicago Lawn
        lead agency for the Chicago Local Initiative Support Corporation’s
        (LISC) New Communities Network. SWOP led two Quality-of-Life planning
        processes. Read the plans here. <br /><br />In 2013, SWOP won the John
        D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation’s MacArthur Award for Creative
        and Effective Institutions. This is the nonprofit equivalent to the
        MacArthur Foundations’ Genius Award for individuals. SWOP won this award
        for its anti-foreclosure work and for the quality of the community
        organizing. SWOP is also the 2017 (for the Reclaiming Campaign) and 2020
        (with LSNA for the Parent Mentor Program) winner of the Woods Fund Power
        of Community Award at the Chicago Neighborhood Development Awards.
